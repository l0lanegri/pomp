    The Teatr Polski Bydgoszcz production <strong>"Mur"</strong> ("The Wall") is a modern and personal retelling of the history of the Berlin Wall. I was contracted to contribute 3D models of the stage for the production process and an animated video segment featuring the Wall materialising from a wireframe.
