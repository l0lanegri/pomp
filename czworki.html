<p><strong>DZIELONE NA CZTERY</strong> or <strong>/4</strong> was a personal brand project created by myself and a couple of other web developers, designers and copywriters. The idea behind it was to use the brand as a sort of collaboration network for our freelance projects - if a project's area of expertise was reaching beyond one of ours' capabilities, we would reach out to other members of the group for collaboration and sign our work with the <strong>/4</strong> mark, signifying the initial number of the group's members.</p>
<p>Well, that, and we wanted to have cooler business cards.</p>
