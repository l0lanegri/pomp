<p><strong>Metro GZM</strong> was a concept for the expansion of public transit in the Katowice metropolitan area, devised by a group of urban planning students and hobbyists between 2017 and 2019. The project's main proposal was the creation of multiple light rail services, minimising costs by the repurposing of largely defunct cargo railways. My contributions to the project included a visual identity, a series of infographics and an ultimately cancelled website project which would use the Jakdojade API to present the impact of such an investment on commute times.</p>
